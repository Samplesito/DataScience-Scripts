# DataScience-Scripts
Hello! 
My name is Jose Luis, and this is my repository for handmade scripts that I think are useful or are able to reproduce more answers.

This is place was created as a environment to save my scripts and share them with anyone who seems them useful.

Finally, you are welcomed to fix it if you find any issues.

Disclaimer: All these scripts are made by myself and are free to use and do not include any personal/business data.
